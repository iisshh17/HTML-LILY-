    <h2>LILY</h2>
    <p>Hey! I'm Lily. My white color makes me pious and a symbolic form of peace. Not everyone likes me but that doesn't bother me. I'm cheerful enough to keep myself happy. I prefer quality over quantity.Making my people smile is my cup of tea. Thus,blooming in every aspect in whichever field I've put to is my go-to play. </p>
